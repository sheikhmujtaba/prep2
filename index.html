    The distribution of the data is showing how frequently an event occurs and how many different events occur in that data. Distribution gives us a visual representation of our data.  
    </p>
    <p>
  In order to add to our distribution and make sense from our data we use level, the purpose of levels in measure the central tendency such as the mean. A mean gives us the average of the data that we are representing. We can also take the weighted mean of a distrubtion to give a better representation of the mean of our data. Moreover, we can also take mode or median if there are several outliers disrupting our mean. 
     </p>
    <p>
    The spread displays how wide or close our data is, we can determine the different number of events that are in our data by looking at the spread of our data. If the data is spread widely then we know that there were multiple events that took place, however, if there are just a few data points then we can conclude that our data is narrow, and a few events took place. The spread of our data helps us identify the outliers in our dataset as well.

   The shape of our data will show us the frequency that each event took place, as we saw in the example of marbles, the marbles were piled up in the middle which shows that the number 7 was more frequent for marbles to land in than any other number. Therefore, the shape of the distribution provided us with an answer for what was the most frequent and least frequent number/event.

    Lastly, the outliers can be identified the first three elements, if the mean is way further from the mode or median, we can easily identify that there are outliers present in the data set. Moreover, we can use the spread and shape to identify the outliers as well. It is important to identify outliers as we can eliminate these outliers to represent the data in a more meaningful way. Outliers give us an insight about how accurate the distribution is, and if there are outliers present then we can easily take other forms of measure to eliminate them.

    In figure one you can see there is one outlier who scored between 400-800, but the shape of the distribution is balanced, as the middle value is most frequent. The data is spread out, but there are not many outliers. The mean is in between 1200-1600
